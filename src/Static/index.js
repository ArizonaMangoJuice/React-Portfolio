        The idea of creating something from scratch that didn't exist before is amazing.
        One of the best things about being a web developer is, new technologies come out and make the developing more interesting.
        You'll never be bored.
        Also, the feeling that you can work as a team, create an app that will help multiple people is one of the best feelings I have ever felt. 
        When i'm not developing I also love doing anything that is competitive, building and fixing computers,
        and hanging out with friends.`,
